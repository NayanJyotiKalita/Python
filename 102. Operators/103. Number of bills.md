# Number of bills

## Problem Description
Given total bills amount and amount of a single bill. Print number of bills.

***Note:*** The total amount is equally splitted in all bills. The number of bills should be an integer value.

### Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 10000 </br>
1 <= M <= 100

---

## Input Format
The first line contains a real number N denoting the total budget. </br>
The second line contains an integer M denoting the value of a single bill.

## Output Format
Print in a single line denoting the total number of bills that can fit in the total budget.

## Example Input
- Input:-
126.3 </br>
5

## Example Output
- Output:- </br>
25

***Note:*** The problem constraints mean that when we test your code, the test cases used in the backend can have input values only within those constraints. 
You need not implement them in your code. You need to make sure your code will work for all such input values! (This note is applicable only when you are going to interview where you will be provided with a compiler with test cases)

## CODE

```python
a = int(float(input()))
b = int(input())
print(a//b)
```

or

```python
print(int(float(input()))//int(input()))
```
