# Print in Reverse

Problem Description

Write a program to print the input array A of size N in reverse order where you have to take integer N and further N elements as input from user.

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000  
1 <= A <= 1000
Input Format

A single line representing **N** followed by N integers of the array **A**
Output Format

A single line containing N space separated integers representing elements of the input array in reverse order.  
**Note** - Keep a space character (' ') at the end of the line.
Example Input

Input 1:

5 1 2 3 4 5
Input 2:

4 10 50 40 80
Example Output

Output 1:

5 4 3 2 1 
Output 2:

80 40 50 10 

Note:
This question requires you to read multiple numbers from input. The first number represents N, which indicates how many more numbers follow. The remaining numbers are converted to integers using the map() function.
Since this concept will be covered later in the module, we encourage you to do some independent research and write your code accordingly.

# CODE

```python
A = input().split()

for i in range(len(A)-1, 0, -1):
  print(A[i], end = " ")
```

or

```python
inputs = input().split()
N = int(inputs[0])
inp = list(map(int, inputs[1:]))
for i in range(N-1, -1, -1):
    # Printing in reverse order
    print(inp[i],end=' ')
```
