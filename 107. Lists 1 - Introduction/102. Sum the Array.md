# Sum the Array

## Problem Description
Write a program to print sum of elements of the input array A of size N. </br>

***Note:*** User is supposed to write a program from scratch to add the elements of the input array and print the result. </br>

```
Note for Python learners: You don't need to write code for taking input. The input is already provided
to you as function parameter
```
```python
eg:
def calculate_sum(input_list):
    # write your code here
```

### Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000 </br>
1 <= A <= 1000

---

### Input Format
- The first integer N denotes the number of integers in the array. </br>
- The next N integers denotes the element of the array A.

### Output Format
A single integer containing sum of elements from the input array.

## Example Input
```
Input 1:
5 1 2 3 4 5

Input 2:
4 10 50 40 80
```

Example Output
```
Output 1:
15

Output 2:
180
```

Example Explanation
```
Input 1:
N = 5 , A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
here the first integer is the size of A and the remaining elements are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
which all sum to 15 

Input 2:
N = 4 , A = [10, 50, 40, 80]
here the first integer is the size of A and the remaining elements are [10, 50, 40, 80]
which all sum to 180
```

# CODE

```python
def calculate_sum(input_list):
    sum1 = 0
    for i in input_list:
        sum1 += i
    return sum1
```
