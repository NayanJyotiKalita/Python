# Difference of even and odd

## Problem Description
Write a program to find the difference between the sum of all even elements and the sum of all odd elements from the given array, A. </br>
***Note:*** The array of elements will be passed as an argument to the function. You don't need to take any input of array.

### Problem Constraints
1 <= len(A) <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 105

---

### Input Format
The only argument is the array of integers, A.

### Output Format
The difference of the even and odd elements sum in integer format.

---

## Example Input
```
Input 1:
1
56 63 87 24 32 13 15 19 44 52

Input 2:
1
2 8 4 6
```

## Example Output
```
Output 1:
11

Output 2:
20
```

## Example Explanation
```
Explanation 1:
The sum of even elements is: 56 + 24 + 32 + 44 + 52 = 208. 
The sum of odd elements is: 63 + 87 + 13 + 15 + 19 = 197. 
Difference between even elements and odd elements sum is 208 - 197 = 11.

Explanation 2:
The sum of even elements is: 2 + 8 + 4 + 6 = 20. 
There is no odd elements. 
Difference between even elements and odd elements sum is 20 - 0 = 20.

# CODE

```python
def even_odd(A):
    diff = 0
    # Write your code here
    even_sum = 0
    odd_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(A)):
        if A[i] % 2 == 0:
            even_sum = even_sum + A[i]
        else:
            odd_sum = odd_sum + A[i]
    
    diff = even_sum - odd_sum
    
    return diff
```
