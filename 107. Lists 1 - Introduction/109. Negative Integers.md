# Negative Integers


## Problem Description
Write a program to print all negative numbers from input array A of size N. Take integer N and N elements of the array as input from user.


### Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000  </br>
-1000 <= A <= 1000

---

### Input Format
A single line representing N followed by N integers of the array A

### Output Format
A single line containing elements from the input array which are negative in the same order.

***Note:*** Keep a space character (' ') at the end of the line. </br>

---

## Example Input
```
Input 1:
5 1 -5 2 -8 -4

Input 2:
4 -1 0 -8 -1
```

## Example Output
```
Output 1:
-5 -8 -4 

Output 2:
-1 -8 -1 
```

## Example explanation:
```
Output 1:
all the negative elements of [5 1 -5 2 -8 -4] are [-5 -8 -4]

Output 2:
all the negative elements of [4 -1 0 -8 -1] are [-1 -8 -1]
```

***Note:***</br>
This question requires you to read a list of integers from input and convert them using the map() function. </br>
I encourage you to do some independent research and write your code accordingly. </br>

# CODE

```python
n = input()
a = n.split(" ")
a.pop()
for i in a:
    if int(i) < 0:
        print(i, end = " ")
```

or

```python
inp = list(map(int,input().split()))
N = inp[0]
# looping from 1 to N
for i in range(1, N+1):
    if inp[i] < 0:
        print(inp[i],end=' ')
```
