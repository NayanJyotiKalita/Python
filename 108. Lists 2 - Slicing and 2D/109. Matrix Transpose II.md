# Matrix Transpose II

Problem Description
Given a 2D integer array A, return the transpose of A.
The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.
Note: The 2D integer array A is already passed as an argument to the function. User don't need to take any input. Just perform the task on the passed arguments and return the required result.


Problem Constraints
1 <= A.size() <= 1000
1 <= A[i].size() <= 1000
1 <= A[i][j] <= 1000


Input Format
First argument is a 2D matrix of integers.

Output Format
You have to return the Transpose of this 2D matrix.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]

Input 2:
A = [[1, 2],[1, 2],[1, 2]]

Example Output
Output 1:
[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]

Output 2:
[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Clearly after converting rows to column and columns to rows of [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]
 we will get [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]].
 
Explanation 2:
After transposing the matrix, A becomes [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]]

# CODE

```python
def transpose(A):
    #Your Code Goes Here
    B = []
    for j in range(len(A[0])):
        inner_loop = []
        for i in range(len(A)):
            inner_loop.append(A[i][j])
        B.append(inner_loop)
    return B
```
