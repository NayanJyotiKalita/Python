# Add the matrices II

Problem Description

You are given two matrices A & B of same size, you have to return another matrix which is the sum of A and B.
**Note:** Matrices are of same size means the number of **rows** and number of **columns** of both matrices are equal.

The Following will give you an idea of matrix addition:

**Note:** The matrices **A** and **B** are already passed as an argument to the function. Users **don't need to take any input**. Just perform the task on the passed arguments and **return the required result**.

Problem Constraints

1 <= A.size(), B.size() <= 1000 1 <= A[i].size(), B[i].size() <= 1000 1 <= A[i][j], B[i][j] <= 1000
Input Format

The first argument is the 2D integer array A The second argument is the 2D integer array B
Output Format

You have to return a vector of vector of integers after doing required operations.
Example Input

Input 1:
```
A = [[1, 2, 3],   
     [4, 5, 6],   
     [7, 8, 9]]  

B = [[9, 8, 7],   
     [6, 5, 4],   
     [3, 2, 1]]
 ```

Input 2:
```
A = [[1, 2, 3],   
     [4, 1, 2],   
     [7, 8, 9]]  

B = [[9, 9, 7],   
     [1, 2, 4],   
     [4, 6, 3]]
 ```

Example Output

Output 1:
```
[[10, 10, 10],   
 [10, 10, 10],   
 [10, 10, 10]]
```
Output 2:
```
[[10, 11, 10],   
 [5,   3,  6],   
 [11, 14, 12]]
```

Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
```
A + B = [[1+9, 2+8, 3+7],  
         [4+6, 5+5, 6+4],  
         [7+3, 8+2, 9+1]]   
      = [[10, 10, 10],   
         [10, 10, 10],   
         [10, 10, 10]].
```
Explanation 2:
```
A + B = [[1+9, 2+9, 3+7],  
         [4+1, 1+2, 2+4],  
         [7+4, 8+6, 9+3]]   
      = [[10, 11, 10],   
         [5,   3,  6],   
         [11, 14, 12]].
```

# CODE

```python
def addMatrices(A, B):
    c = []
    for i in range(len(A)):
        inner_list = []
        for j in range(len(A[i])):
            inner_list.append(A[i][j] + B[i][j])
        c.append(inner_list)
    return c
```
