# Inverted Numeric Pyramid

## Problem Description
Take an integer N as input, print the corresponding Numeric Inverted Half Pyramid pattern for N.

For example if N = 4 then pattern will be like: </br>
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1
```

### Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100

---

## Input Format
First and only line of input contains a single integer N.

## Output Format
Output the Numeric Inverted Half Pyramid pattern corresponding to the given N.

***NOTE:*** </br> 
There should be no extra spaces after last integer and before first integer in any . All integers in any row in the pattern are separated by a single space.

----

## Example Input
- **Input 1:** </br>
 2

- **Input 2:** </br>
 3
 
## Example Output
- **Output 1:** </br>
```
1 2
1
```

- **Output 2:** </br>
```
1 2 3
1 2
1
```

## Example Explanation

- **Example Input 1:** </br>
We have the input of integer as 2. So there will be 2 rows. </br>
The first row will have 2 integers separated by a single space (1 2) </br>
The next row will have 2-1 = 1 integer (1) </br>
As we do not have any more integers left we stop printing the pattern.

- **Example Input 2:** </br>
We have the input of integer as 3. So there will be 3 rows. </br>
The first row will have 3 integers separated by a single space (1 2 3) </br>
The next row will have 3-1 = 2 integers separated by a single space (1 2) </br>
The next row will have 2-1 = 1 integer.(1) </br>
As we do not have any more integers left we stop printing the pattern. </br>

# CODE

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    j = 1
    while j < i:
        print(j, end=" ")
        j = j+1
    print(j)
```
