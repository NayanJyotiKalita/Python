# Least Common Multiple

Problem Description
Write a program to input an integer T and then for each test case input two integers A and B in two different lines and then print T lines containing Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two given 2 numbers A and B.
Note: LCM of two integers is the smallest positive integer divisible by both.


Problem Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= A,B <= 1000

---

Input Format
The first line contains T which means number of test cases.
Next 2T lines contains input A and B for each testcase.
First line of each testcase contain an integer A and second line of the testcase contains input B.

Output Format
T lines each containing an integer representing LCM of A & B.

Example Input
Input 1:
3
2
3
9
6
2
6

Example Output
Output 1:
6
18
6

Example Explanation
Explanation:
 In first testcase 6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 3 (3 * 2 = 6).
 In second testcase 18 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 9 (9 * 2 = 18) and 6 (6 * 3 = 18).
 In third testcase  6 is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by both 2 (2 * 3 = 6) and 6 (6 * 1 = 6).

# CODE

```python
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    A = int(input())
    B = int(input())
    x = max(A, B)
    while True:
        if (x % A == 0 and x % B == 0):
            print(x)
            break
        x += 1
```

or

```python
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
  a = int(input())
  b = int(input())
  m = a*b
  c = max(a,b)
  for j in range(c, m+1):
    if j%a == 0 and j%b == 0:
      print(j)
      break
```

or

```python
t = int(input())
for j in range(t):
    A = int(input())
    B = int(input())
    G = 1
    # Loop from 1 to minimum of A and B and largest number which divides A and B is HCF
    for i in range(1, min(A, B) + 1):
        if A % i == 0 and B % i == 0:
            G = i
    # LCM will be A*B/HCF       
    L = (A * B) // G
    print(L)
return 0
```
