# HCF using Loop

## Problem Description
Write a program to input an integer T which represents the number of test cases. For each test case input two integers A and B in two different lines. For each pair of A and B print the HCF of the given two numbers.

### Problem Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000 </br>
1 <= A,B <= 1000000

---

### Input Format
The first line of input contains T which means number of test cases. </br>
Next 2T lines contains input A and B for each testcase. </br>
First line of each testcase contain an integer A and second line of the testcase contains input B.

### Output Format
T lines each containing an integer representing HCF of A & B.

## Example Input
- **Input 1:** </br>
2 </br>
15 </br>
105 </br>
24 </br>
36

## Example Output
- **Output 1:** </br>
15 </br>
12

# CODE

```python
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    A = int(input())
    B = int(input())
    x = min(A,B)
    for i in range(x, 0, -1):
        if A%i == 0 and B%i == 0:
            print(i)
            break
```

or

```python
    t = int(input())
    for j in range(t):
        a = int(input())
        b = int(input())
        ans = 0
        mi = min(a, b)
        # Loop from 1 to minimum of a and b and largest number which divides a and b is HCF
        for i in range(1, mi+1):
            if a%i==0 and b%i==0:
                ans = i
        print(ans)
```

'or'

### Using function format

```python
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for j in range(t):
        a = int(input())
        b = int(input())
        ans = 0
        mi = min(a, b)
        # Loop from 1 to minimum of a and b and largest number which divides a and b is HCF
        for i in range(1, mi+1):
            if a%i==0 and b%i==0:
                ans = i
        print(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
