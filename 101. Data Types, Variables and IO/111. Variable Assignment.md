# Variable Assignment

**In Python, a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name. To create a variable x with a value of 5, you use =, like this example:**
```
x = 5
```

You can now use the name of this variable, x, instead of the actual value, 5. </br>
Remember, = in Python means assignment, it doesn't test equality! Try it in the exercise </br?

## Instructions
Create a variable `savings` with the value of 100. </br>
Check out this variable by typing `print(savings)` in the script.

# CODE

```python
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)
```
