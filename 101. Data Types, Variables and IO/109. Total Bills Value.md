# Total Bills Value

## Problem Description
Given the value of a single bill and the number of bills you received, print the total value of the bills. 

***Note:*** The value of all the bills are same

### Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100 </br>
1 <= M <= 100

## Input Format
The first line of the input is an integer N denoting the value of a single bill. </br>
The second line of the input is an integer M denoting the number of bills.

## Example Input
- Input:- </br>
12 </br>
10

## Example Output

120

***Note:*** The problem constraints mean that when we test your code, the test cases used in the backend can have input values only within those constraints. 
You need not implement them in your code. You need to make sure your code will work for all such input values! (This note is applicable only when you are going to interview where you will be provided with a compiler with test cases)

# CODE

```python
a = input()
b = input()

print(int(a) * int(b))
```
