# Class Performance 2

## Problem Description
You have been given a dataset for marks of 2 subjects, scored by students of classes ClassA and ClassB. You now want to compare the performances of class A and class B by finding out the average performance of the classes. 
Write a program to find if class A performed better. Print True is Class A is strictly better else return False.

### Input Format
There are 4 lines in the input. </br>
The first and second lines are marks of subjects for Class A. </br>
The third and fourth lines are marks of subjects for Class B.

## Example Input
- Input 1:- </br>
80 </br>
27 </br>
54 </br>
61 

- Input 2:-</br>
54 </br>
61 </br>
80 </br>
27

## Example Output
- Output 1:- </br>
False

- Output 2:- </br>
True

## Sample Exaplanation
- Explanation 1:- </br>
The average marks of class A is (80 + 27)/2 = 53.5, and the average of class B is (54 + 61)/2 = 57.5, so class B's average </br>
is better hence False is printed.

- Explanation 2:- </br>
The average marks of class A is(54 + 61)/2 = 57.5, and the average of class B is(80 + 27)/2 = 53.5, so class B's average </br>
is better hence True is printed.

# CODE

```python
ClassA_1 = int(input())
ClassA_2 = int(input())
ClassB_1 = int(input())
ClassB_2 = int(input())

ClassA = (ClassA_1 + ClassA_2) / 2
ClassB = (ClassB_1 + ClassB_2) / 2

if ClassA > ClassB:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
```
