 1 </br>
 2
- Output 2: </br>
 -1 </br>
 3

## Example Explanation
- Explanation 1: </br>
 Cost Price = 2 </br>
 Selling Price = 4 </br>
 As Cost Price < Selling Price, there is a profit. </br>
 Total Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = 4 - 2 = 2

- Explanation 2: </br>

 Selling Price = 1 </br>
 As Cost Price > Selling Price, there is a loss. </br>
 Total Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price = 4 - 1 = 3
