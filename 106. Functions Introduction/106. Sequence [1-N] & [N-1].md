# Sequence [1-N] & [N-1]

## Problem Description:

Write a program to print all Natural numbers from 1 to N and from N to 1 inclusive, where N is given as an argument. </br>

**Note1:** *First print from 1 to N then in new line print again from N to 1* </br>

**Note2:** *You need not take input in this problem, you need to only implement the function provided.* </br>

**Note3:** *There is 1 line gap between two output lines and a space between numbers in same line.*


### Problem Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000 </br>

---

### Input Format:
The first line indicates the number of test cases t </br>
The next t lines will have different values of N according to testcases

### Output Format:
For each testcase there will be two lines of output:  
The first line is N space-separated integers from 1 to N.
The next line is N space-separated integers from N to 1.

## Sample Input:
1 </br>
5

## Sample Output: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 
5 4 3 2 1
```

# CODE

```python
def sequence(n):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i == n:
            print(i)
        else:
            print(i, end = " ")
    for j in range(n, 0, -1):
        if j == 1:
            print(j)
        else:
            print(j, end = " ")
```

or

```python
def sequence(n):
    # Loop from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i != n:
            print(i, end = " ")
        else:
            print(i)
    # Loop from 0 to n-1 and print n-j
    for j in range(0, n):
         if j != n-1:
            print(n-j, end=" ")
         else:
            print(n-j)
```
