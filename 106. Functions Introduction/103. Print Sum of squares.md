# Print Sum of squares

## Problem Description
Given an integer n, write a program to return the sum of squares of first n natural numbers in integer format.

**Note1:** </br>
The formula for the sum of squares of first n natural numbers is: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

**Note2:** </br>
You need not take input in this problem, only implement the function provided.

### Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100

---

### Input Format:
The first line indicates the number of test cases. </br>
For each testcase there will be a single line of input with an integer representing n for that testcase.

### Output Format:
Sum of squares of n natural numbers in integer format

---

## Sample Input:
1 </br>
6

## Sample Output:
91

## Sample explanation:
According to the formula sum of first 6 natural numbers is 6*(6+1)(12+1)/6=91

---

# CODE

```python
def sum_squares(n):
    # Use the formula to find the sum of squares
    ans= (n*(n+1)*(2*n+1))/6
    ans=int(ans)
    return ans
```
