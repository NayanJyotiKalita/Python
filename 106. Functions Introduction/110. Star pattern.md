# Star pattern

## Problem Description

Write a function to print a pattern similar to the one shown in the sample using n which is given to you as an argument to a function. Here n defines the number of rows.

***Note:*** There are no spaces between the stars in the first row, and there are no spaces at the end of each row. </br>

### Input Format
The only argument to the function in an integer n.

### Output Format
Print Star Pattern in string format for each testcase.

## Sample Input:
8

## Sample Output:

```
********
*     *
*    *
*   *
*  *
* *
**
*
```

## Sample Explanation:

In the first row, (n=8) stars are printed. </br>
In the second row, 2 stars are printed with 5 spaces between them. </br>
This number of spaces keeps decreasing by 1 after the second row until the last row where the number of spaces becomes zero and only one star is printed.

# CODE

```python
def star(n):
    # Loop from 1 to n
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        # Loop from i to n
        for j in range(i,n+1):
            if i==j or i==1 or j==n:
                print('*',end='')
            else:
                print(' ',end='')
        print()
```
