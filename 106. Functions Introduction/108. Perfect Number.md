# Perfect Number

## Problem Description:

Write a function to check whether a given number **n** as an input to the function is a perfect number or not. If the given integer is a perfect number return **1** else return **0**. </br>

**Note:** In number theory, a perfect number is a **positive integer** that is equal to the sum of its proper **positive divisors**, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum).

### Input Format:
The only argument to the function is an integer n.

### Output Format:
Print out 1 if the number is perfect else 0 in integer format.

## Sample Input:
6

## Sample Output:
1

## Sample Explanation:
Given number is 6. 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. Hence 6 is a perfect number.

# CODE

```python
def perfect_number(n):
    sum = 0
    # For each number from 1 to n/2 check if it divides n then add it to sum
    for x in range(1, (n//2)+1):
        if n % x == 0:
            sum += x
    return 1 if sum == n else 0
```

or

```python
def perfect_number(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1,n):
        if n % i == 0:
            sum = sum + i
    
    if sum == n:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
```
