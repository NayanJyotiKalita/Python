# Sphere Volume

## Problem Description:

You are given a positive integer r denoting the radius of a sphere as a parameter. Write a program to calculate the volume of the sphere. The volume of a sphere having radius R is given by (4 * π * R3) / 3. </br>

**NOTE:** Return the volume of the sphere up to two decimal places. You can use round(). </br>

**NOTE2:** Use pi as 22/7 (not math.pi). </br>

### Input Format:
The first line indicates the number of the test cases. For each testcase there will be one line of input: </br>
The one line contains r in integer format.

### Output Format:
The volume of the sphere in float format is printed for each testcase in a new line.
