# Answer

*global,local,local*

**Explanation:** </br>
The first call to the print function that gets executed is the first one inside of the foo function. </br>
This call prints “global,” because at that execution point in the program, x has only been defined as “global” in the global scope. </br>
However, after this first print statement, we assign x to the new value of “local”, meaning that when x is printed again right after, we print “local”. </br>
We do not create a new x in the local scope, instead we change the value of x in the global scope. </br>
Finally, the last call to print takes in the x defined in the global scope, which was modified in the foo function because of the presence of the global keyword. </br>
Therefore, this call prints “local”.
