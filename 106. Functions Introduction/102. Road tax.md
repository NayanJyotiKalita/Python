The first line indicates the number of test cases. For each testcase there will be a single line of input representing the cost price.

### Output Format:
Return tax in float format.

## Sample Input 1
1 </br>
25000

## Sample Output 2
1250.0

## Sample Explanation 1
The given cost price of vehicle is 25000 which is less than 50,000. </br>
Hence the tax applicable is 5%. So if we calculate 5% of 25,000, it evaluates to 1250.0.


## Sample Input 2
1 </br>
60000

## Sample Output 2
6000.0

## Sample Explanation 2
The given cost price of vehicle is 60,000 which is greater than 50,000 but less than 75,000. </br>
Hence the tax applicable is 10%. So if we calculate 10% of 60,000, it evaluates to 6000.0.

# CODE

```python
def road_tax(price):
    tax = None
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    if price > 100000:
        tax = price * 20/100
    elif price > 75000:
        tax = price * 15/100
    elif price > 50000:
        tax = price * 10/100
    else:
        tax = price * 5/100
        
    tax = round(tax, 1)

    return tax
```
