# CODE

```python
def solve(A):
    res = []
    v = [ord("a"), ord("e"), ord("i"), ord("o"), ord("u")]
    count_vow = 0
    count_cons = 0
    for i in A:
        if ord(i) in v:
            count_vow += 1
        else:
            count_cons += 1
    res.append(count_vow)
    res.append(count_cons)
    
    return res
```

or

```python
def solve(self, A):
    ans = [0]*2
    vowels = "aeiou"
    for i in range(0,len(A)):
        if A[i] in vowels:
            ans[0] += 1
      else: 
          ans[1] += 1
    return ans
```
