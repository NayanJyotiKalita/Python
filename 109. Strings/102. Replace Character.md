### Problem Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 105
A[i] ∈ ['a'-'z']
97 <= B, C <= 122
```

---

### Input Format
```
First argument is a character string A.
Second argument is an integer B.
Third argument is an integer C.
```

### Output Format
Return the resultant string after replacing the character(s).

---

## Example Input
```
Input 1:
 A = "aabbccbb"
 B = 98 
 C = 100
 
Input 2:
 A = "abc"
 B = 100
 C = 97
```

## Example Output
```
Output 1:
 aaddccdd 
Output 2:
 abc 
```

## Example Explanation
```
Explanation 1:
 Character having ASCII code equal to 98 = 'b' 
 Character having ASCII code equal to 100 = 'd'
 Character 'b' occurs at positions 3, 4, 7 and 8 in "aabbaabb".
 After replacing the characters, string becomes "aaddaadd".
 
Explanation 2:
 Character having ASCII code equal to 100 = 'd'
 Character 'd' is not present in "abc".
 The resultant string is same as string A.
```

 # CODE

 ```python
    # @param A : string
    # @param B : integer
    # @param C : integer
    def solve(A, B, C):
        return A.replace(chr(B),chr(C))
```
