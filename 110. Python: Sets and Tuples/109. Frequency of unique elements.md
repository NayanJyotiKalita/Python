# Frequency of unique elements

Problem Description:
Write a function to print out the frequency of all the unique elements present in a given tuple.

Input Format:
The one input line consists of a tuple.

Output Format:
Unique elements and their frequencies are expected to be printed as follows:  
unique_element1 : freq1  
unique_element2 : freq2  
.  
.



Sample Input 1:
(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)

Sample Output 1:
10 : 3
8 : 4
5 : 2
2 : 2
15 : 1  


Sample Input 2:
(100, -10, -10, “ONE”, [22], [22], “ONE”)

Sample Output 2:

100 : 1
-10 : 2
ONE : 2
[22] : 2

# CODE

```python
def unique_count(tup):
    ''' input:tup-indicates the tuple
         output:Print the unique elements and their frequency'''
    new_list = []
    for i in range(len(tup)):
        if tup[i] in new_list:
            pass
        else:
            new_list.append(tup[i])
                       
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        print(new_list[i], ":", tup.count(new_list[i]))
```

or

```python
def unique_count(tup):
    lst = []
    for v in tup:
        # We got v first time
        if v not in lst:
            lst.append(v)
            print(v, ':', tup.count(v))
```
