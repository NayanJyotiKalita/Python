Sample Input:
1
in data analysis we use data and process it further to create better interpreted data
more and more data will be passively collected

Sample Output:
20

Sample explanation:
{'use', 'process', 'create', 'better', 'analysis', 'in', 'it', 'further', 'and', 'we', 'data', 'interpreted', 'to'} 
represent the 13 unique words from sentence1 and {'collected', 'more', 'be', 'and', 'data', 'passively', 'will'} 
represent the 7 unique words from sentence2. Therefore 13 + 7 = 20 is returned.

Note:
If a word is present in both sentences it should be counted separately for both sentences.

# CODE

```python
def set_operation(sent1,sent2):
    ''' input:sent1,sent2-two sentences taken as inputs
         output:return the sum of length of unique words.'''
    
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    set1 = set(sent1.split(" "))
    set2 = set(sent2.split(" "))
    return len(set1) + len(set2)
```
