# Divide the tuple

## Problem Description:
Write a program to divide a given tuple into two tuples that contain even and odd indexed elements of the original tuple. Print both these tuples in the given output format. </br>

***Note:*** The input tuple follows 1-based indexing. This means the element at index 0 is treated as having index as 1. </br>

*For example, (9,2,3). The 1-based index of 2 is 2.*

---

### Input Format:
The input contains a tuple as an argument to the function.

### Output Format:
```
Print two tuples one for odd indexed elements and another for even indexed elements in the following format:
Odd: (....)
Even: (....)
```

---

## Sample Input:
```
1
(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)
```

## Sample Output:
```
Odd: (10, 5, 10, 10, 5, 8)
Even: (8, 2, 15, 8, 8, 2)
```

# CODE

```python
def odd_even_split_tuple(tup):
    ''' input:tup-indicates the tuple
        output:print two tuples one for even indexed and odd indexed in the given output format'''
    
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    odd_list = []
    even_list = []
    for i in range(1, len(tup)+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even_list.append(tup[i-1])
        else:
            odd_list.append(tup[i-1])
    odd = tuple(odd_list)
    even = tuple(even_list)
    
    print("Odd:", odd)
    print("Even:", even)
```

or 

```python
def odd_even_split_tuple(tup):
    odd = tup[::2]
    even = tup[1::2]
    print("Odd:", odd)
    print("Even:", even)
```
