## Problem Description
Write a program to print all even numbers from 1 to N where you have to take N as input from the user. </br>

***Note:***
Use while-loop OR for-loop, according to session flow.

***Note:*** 
You can use int(input()) for obtaining user input of number N.

## Example Input
- **Input 1:** </br>
5

- **Input 2:** </br>
10

## Example Output
- **Output 1:** </br>
2 4 

- **Output 2:** </br>
2 4 6 8 10 
  
## Example Explanation

- **Output 1:** </br>
2 4 </br>
The even numbers between 1 to 5 are 2 and 4. So the numbers 2 and 4 are printed separated by space.

- **Output 2:** </br>
2 4 6 8 10 </br>
The even numbers between 1 to 10 are 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. So the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are printed separated by space.

# CODE

```python
N = int(input())
i = 1
while i<=N:
    if i%2 == 0:
        print(i, end=" ")
    i += 1
```
