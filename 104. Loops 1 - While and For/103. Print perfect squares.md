```python
A = int(input())
i = 1
# Start i from 1 and go until i*i is not greater than n
while i*i <= A:
    print(i*i, end=" ")
    i += 1
```

or 

### In function format

```python
def main():
    A = int(input())
    i = 1
    # Start i from 1 and go until i*i is not greater than n
    while i*i <= A:
        print(i*i, end=" ")
        i += 1
    return 0

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
