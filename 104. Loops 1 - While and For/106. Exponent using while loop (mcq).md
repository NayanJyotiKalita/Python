# Exponent using while loop

## Complete the following code snippet in order to find the exponent, i.e. the number of times base should be multiplied by itself to get num.

```python
num=16
base=4
cnt=0
while(num>1):
  ?????
  cnt+=1
print(cnt)
```

### Q. Which of the options can be used in place of blank(?????) in order to get the power value?

An image to illustrate what exponent and base number mean:

***Note -*** </br>
Assume that we can always get num by multiplying a base by 1 positive number of times.

## Choose the correct answer from below:
    
    - num -= base

    - num /= base

    - num *= base

    - num += base
